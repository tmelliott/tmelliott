I like making things with code and solving (or allowing others to solve) problems with those things. I'm currently working on new packages to make [Rserve](https://www.rforge.net/Rserve/) easier to incorporate into a modern web workflow, using e.g., ReactJS.

I'm the lead developer of [iNZight](https://github.com/iNZightVIT) which is an *R*-based GUI for exploring data for beginners. Re-building this is the end-goal of the above work.

I usually work with R for statistical tool development, and Javascript (ReactJS or NextJS) for web development.
