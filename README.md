I like making things with code and solving (or allowing others to solve) problems with those things. 

I'm the lead developer of [iNZight](https://github.com/iNZightVIT) which is an *R*-based GUI for exploring data for beginners. 

I usually work with R for statistical tool development, and Javascript (ReactJS or NextJS) for web development.
