# Kia ora

I like making things with code and solving (or allowing others to solve) problems with those things. 

I'm the lead developer of [iNZight](https://github.com/iNZightVIT) which is an *R*-based GUI for exploring data for beginners. 

Programs and languages that I usually dabble in include:

* R
* C++
* LaTeX
* HTML/CSS
