# Kia ora

I like making things with code and solving (or allowing others to solve) problems with those things. 

I'm the lead developer of [iNZight](https://github.com/iNZightVIT) which is an R-based GUI for exploring data for beginners. 

I might get around to making a somewhat-cool profile into page (on a weekend when it's too miserable to go outside and garden...).
